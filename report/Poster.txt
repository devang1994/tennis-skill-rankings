"Poster content and form - The poster should include the definition of the problem you have worked on and highlight where significant contributions were made (modeling, inference or learning); explain the approach taken in solving the problem, and mention previous work relied upon. Use large fonts for text within your poster and do not include too much of it, instead, include a lot of images to describe your results and analysis clearly."
